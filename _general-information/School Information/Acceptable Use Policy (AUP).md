<p><strong><u>Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) for use of EdTech Resources</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Purpose of the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)</strong>
</p>
<p>Technology is an essential part of learning in today’s world. This Acceptable
Use Policy (AUP) establishes guidelines on the appropriate use of EdTech
resources to help students and parents understand how to use these resources
safely and responsibly, in line with efforts to develop their digital literacies
and growth as digitally responsible citizens.</p>
<p>EdTech resources include the following, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Learning devices (e.g. school devices such as iPads or Laptops); and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ICT system accounts (e.g. Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) and iCON),
and school internet networks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, please refer to: Student Kit on Cyber Wellness and
Learning with a Learning Device (Primary) – <a href="https://go.gov.sg/cw-studentkitpri" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/cw-studentkitpri</a>
</p>
<p>As partners in nurturing responsible digital citizens, the school, parents,
and students share the responsibility of ensuring that all EdTech resources
– such as learning devices, online resources, AI tools, ICT system accounts,
and school internet networks – are used <strong>safely</strong>, <strong>ethically</strong>,
and <strong>purposefully</strong>. The following guidelines set out what
students should and should not do when using them.</p>
<p><strong>General</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students should not attempt to access data, system and information that
they are not authorised to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students are reminded that the use of the school’s EdTech resources should
solely be for the purpose of learning.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Being a Responsible Digital Citizen</strong>
</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Students should interact with others in a respectful and
responsible way. They should not post online remarks that are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>racially and/or religiously insensitive;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>vulgar and/or offensive; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hurtful to others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students should not
use any devices to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>store, modify, create or share content (e.g. documents, presentations,
pictures and videos) that is inappropriate (e.g. indecent, pornographic,
defamatory, hurtful to self or others); or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make threats, cause harassment or embarrassment, impersonate or intimidate
others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students should not
use MOE/school-deployed ICT system accounts for any commercial activities
(e.g. buying and selling of goods and services).</p>
<p><em>Non-compliance with the above will lead to disciplinary action in accordance with the school’s discipline policy.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Respecting Copyright</strong>
</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students should always
acknowledge or cite the sources of information, pictures, or videos used
in their school projects to show respect for other’s work.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students should not
use, copy, edit or share digital files in an unauthorised or illegal manner.</p>
<p><strong>Using Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong>
</p>
<p><em>The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in school is guided by age-appropriate practices. While many AI tools (such as ChatGPT) are designed for users </em><strong><em>aged 13 and above</em></strong><em>, the following serves as guidance for how AI-related learning experiences are designed for primary school students. Teachers will guide students in understanding how AI works, its benefits and limitations, and how to use it ethically and safely for learning purposes.</em>
</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students are to be
honest and take responsibility for their own learning when using AI, &nbsp;understanding
that they are ultimately short-changing themselves if they pass off other’s
work as their own.</p>
<p><strong>Staying Safe and Secure Online</strong>
</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students should report
any incidents (e.g. unusual device behaviour or inappropriate use of devices),
to the school.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students are reminded to develop online safety
habits. This includes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>not disclosing personal access credentials (e.g. MIMS login ID and password,
SLS Login ID, etc.), sensitive personal data (e.g. home address, passwords)
online or on AI platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not sharing personal information, images, or school-related content on
external platforms without teacher or parent consent. The school also takes
care to safeguard students’ data in accordance with MOE’s data protection
guidelines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>verifying credibility of online content before sharing, avoiding clicking
on suspicious links or downloading unknown files, and being cautious when
interacting with others online (e.g. on social media) by not engaging with
strangers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students should exercise caution regarding
the limitations of AI tools, including potential inaccuracies / fabricated
responses, inherent biases and outdated information.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Well-being and Balance</strong>
</p>
<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students are reminded to balance screentime
with other activities including physical exercise and face-to-face social
interactions.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students should avoid excessive use of devices
outside learning hours. For guidance, please refer to <a href="https://www.healthhub.sg/programmes/parent-hub/grow-well-sg/nurture-healthy-behaviours/#learn-well" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Parent Hub: Grow Well SG - Nurturing Healthy Behaviours</a>.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students should take regular breaks to rest
their eyes and mind.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students are reminded to practice good sleep
hygiene by not using devices one hour before bedtime.</p>
