<h3><strong>HOME-SCHOOL PARTNERSHIP</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We value open communication between parents and the school to ensure your
child's/ward’s learning experience is well-supported. Below are the ways
you can stay in touch with us while allowing teacher to balance their professional
duties and personal commitments:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>School Communication Platform</strong>:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The school uses *<strong>Parents Gateway </strong>(PG) to keep parents
informed about important announcements, events, and updates. We encourage
parents to regularly check the PG app for updates regarding school announcements
and events. Teachers are not required nor encouraged to share personal
mobile numbers or communicate via social media platforms.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Contacting Teachers</strong>:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can contact your child’s teacher via email or through the school phone
number for any inquiries or concerns. Teachers aim to respond to emails
within 3 working days for simple queries and within up to 21 working days
for complex queries that require investigation. For more urgent matters,
please contact the General Office as teachers may be in class or unavailable.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Communication Hours</strong>:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Parents are encouraged to contact teachers during school hours: 7.30am
to 5.00pm, Monday to Friday, during term time. Teachers are not expected
to respond to queries outside these hours, on weekends and during school
holidays.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Parent-Teacher Meetings</strong>:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Parent-teacher meeting (PTM) will be scheduled at the end of semester
1 to discuss your child’s academic and social progress. You will be notified
in advance about the meeting. Should you need to meet with a teacher, you
can arrange an appointment by contacting the teacher via email or through
the General Office.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Student Handbook:</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Every student at Northoaks is expected to bring their Student Handbook
to school every day. The handbook is used to record homework, and notes
from teachers. If you need to contact your child’s/ward’s teacher, you
may write a note in your child’s/ward’s handbook. Remind your child/ward
to show the handbook to their teachers. It is important that parents work
closely and communicate frequently with the teachers to ensure that your
child/ward is progressing well and developing good habits and study skills.</p>
<ol start="2" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>All visitors, including parents, are not permitted to go directly to the
classrooms, staff room, or any other area of the school to meet teachers
or students. All visitors must report to the General Office, where staff
will assist you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In case of an emergency, the school will contact parents. It is essential
that parents/guardians provide the school with their updated contact number(s).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If parents need to take a student out of school before dismissal for a
valid reason, the form teacher must be informed in advance with a written
note or letter submitted through the *PG app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a student needs to leave the school before dismissal, one parent /
guardian is required to fetch the child from the General Office and sign
the “Student Early Dismissal Record” book. This procedure is in place to
ensure the safety of our students.</p>
