<h3><strong>HOME-SCHOOL PARTNERSHIP</strong></h3>
<p>1. We value open communication between parents and the school to ensure
your</p>
<p>child's/ward’s learning experience is well-supported. Below are the ways
you can stay</p>
<p>in touch with us while allowing teacher to balance their professional
duties and</p>
<p>personal commitments:</p>
<p>o <strong>School Communication Platform</strong>: The school uses *<strong>Parents Gateway </strong>(PG)
to</p>
<p>keep parents informed about important announcements, events, and</p>
<p>updates. We encourage parents to regularly check the PG app for updates</p>
<p>regarding school announcements and events. Teachers are not required nor</p>
<p>encouraged to share personal mobile numbers or communicate via social</p>
<p>media platforms.</p>
<p>o <strong>Contacting Teachers</strong>: You can contact your child’s teacher
via email or through</p>
<p>the school phone number for any inquiries or concerns. Teachers aim to</p>
<p>respond to emails within 3 working days for simple queries and within
up to</p>
<p>21 working days for complex queries that require investigation. For more</p>
<p>urgent matters, please contact the General Office as teachers may be in
class</p>
<p>or unavailable.</p>
<p>o <strong>Communication Hours</strong>: Parents are encouraged to contact
teachers during</p>
<p>school hours: 7.30am to 5.00pm, Monday to Friday, during term time.</p>
<p>Teachers are not expected to respond to queries outside these hours, on</p>
<p>weekends and during school holidays.</p>
<p>o <strong>Parent-Teacher Meetings</strong>: Parent-teacher meeting (PTM)
will be scheduled at</p>
<p>the end of semester 1 to discuss your child’s academic and social progress.
You</p>
<p>will be notified in advance about the meeting. Should you need to meet
with</p>
<p>a teacher, you can arrange an appointment by contacting the teacher via
email</p>
<p>or through the General Office.</p>
<p>o <strong>Student Handbook: </strong>Every student at Northoaks is expected
to bring their</p>
<p>Student Handbook to school every day. The handbook is used to record</p>
<p>homework, and notes from teachers.</p>
<p>If you need to contact your child’s/ward’s teacher, you may write a note
in</p>
<p>your child’s/ward’s handbook. Remind your child/ward to show the handbook</p>
<p>to their teachers. It is important that parents work closely and communicate</p>
<p>frequently with the teachers to ensure that your child/ward is progressing
well</p>
<p>and developing good habits and study skills.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. All visitors, including parents, are not permitted to go directly to
the classrooms, staff</p>
<p>room, or any other area of the school to meet teachers or students. All
visitors must</p>
<p>report to the General Office, where staff will assist you.</p>
<p>3. In case of an emergency, the school will contact parents. It is essential
that</p>
<p>parents/guardians provide the school with their updated contact number(s).</p>
<p>4. If parents need to take a student out of school before dismissal for
a valid reason, the</p>
<p>form teacher must be informed in advance with a written note or letter
submitted</p>
<p>through the *PG app.</p>
<p>5. If a student needs to leave the school before dismissal, one parent
/ guardian is</p>
<p>required to fetch the child from the General Office and sign the “Student
Early</p>
<p>Dismissal Record” book. This procedure is in place to ensure the safety
of our</p>
<p>students.</p>
<p>* <em>Parents are strongly encouraged to download the app and come onboard PG.</em>
