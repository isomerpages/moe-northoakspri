<h3><strong>HOME-SCHOOL PARTNERSHIP</strong></h3>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We value open communication between parents and the school to ensure your
child's/ward’s learning experience is well-supported. Below are the ways
you can stay in touch with us while allowing teacher to balance their professional
duties and personal commitments:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>School Communication Platform</strong>:</p>
<p>The school uses *<strong>Parents Gateway </strong>(PG) to keep parents
informed about important announcements, events, and</p>
<p>updates. We encourage parents to regularly check the PG app for updates
regarding school announcements and events. Teachers are not required nor
encouraged to share personal mobile numbers or communicate via social media
platforms.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contacting Teachers</strong>:</p>
<p>You can contact your child’s teacher via email or through</p>
<p>the school phone number for any inquiries or concerns. Teachers aim to
respond to emails within 3 working days for simple queries and within up
to 21 working days for complex queries that require investigation. For
more</p>
<p>urgent matters, please contact the General Office as teachers may be in
class or unavailable.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communication Hours</strong>: Parents are encouraged to contact
teachers during school hours: 7.30am to 5.00pm, Monday to Friday, during
term time. Teachers are not expected to respond to queries outside these
hours, on weekends and during school holidays.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Parent-Teacher Meetings</strong>: Parent-teacher meeting (PTM)
will be scheduled at the end of semester 1 to discuss your child’s academic
and social progress. You</p>
<p>will be notified in advance about the meeting. Should you need to meet
with a teacher, you can arrange an appointment by contacting the teacher
via email</p>
<p>or through the General Office.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Student Handbook: </strong>Every student at Northoaks is expected
to bring their Student Handbook to school every day. The handbook is used
to record homework, and notes from teachers. If you need to contact your
child’s/ward’s teacher, you may write a note in your child’s/ward’s handbook.
Remind your child/ward to show the handbook to their teachers. It is important
that parents work closely and communicate frequently with the teachers
to ensure that your child/ward is progressing well and developing good
habits and study skills.</p>

<li>
<p>All visitors, including parents, are not permitted to go directly to the
classrooms, staff room, or any other area of the school to meet teachers
or students. All visitors must report to the General Office, where staff
will assist you.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In case of an emergency, the school will contact parents. It is essential
that parents/guardians provide the school with their updated contact number(s).
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If parents need to take a student out of school before dismissal for a
valid reason, the form teacher must be informed in advance with a written
note or letter submitted through the *PG app.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a student needs to leave the school before dismissal, one parent /
guardian is required to fetch the child from the General Office and sign
the “Student Early Dismissal Record” book. This procedure is in place to
ensure the safety of our students.</p>
