Northoaks Primary School celebrated its first Lotus Award, the highest award given to schools for green efforts under the Singapore Environment Council - Starhub School Green Awards 2017 (SEC-SGA). The Award is a self-audited voluntary environmental programme which serves as a platform for students to develop and showcase their environmental efforts through customised activities.  
  
The school’s environmental efforts led by the Primary 4 CCA ECO Team included projects such as Recycling@Northoaks, Water and Energy Saving Efforts, planting in Curious Garden @ Northoaks, EM Composting, student-led sharing sessions. These projects have helped students gain a better understanding of the environment and motivated them to take on the role of advocacy in initiating and leading environmental projects within and beyond the school.
