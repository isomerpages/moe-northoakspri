<p style="text-align: justify">Northoaks Primary School started in 2014 and in 2016, the school community expanded with the set-up of MOE Kindergarten @ Northoaks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past years, the school has grown and has celebrated many milestones and achievements.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are testimony to the dedication of the staff of the school as well as the&nbsp;strong support of our parents and partners.

  

</p><p style="text-align: justify">In Northoaks Primary, we believe in developing students who are deeply rooted in the schoolâ€™s core values of honesty, empathy, appreciation, respect and tenacity (HEART).&nbsp; These values serve as a moral compass for each child to be able to Lead and Learn with HEART.&nbsp; We also believe that every child has the ability to Grow and Glow and that they learn best when they encounter learning as a meaningful and joyful experience.&nbsp; As a school, we support our children by providing a total curriculum that enriches and stretches each child to the best of his/her potential.&nbsp; In doing so, we help them discover their strengths, and acquire the skills, values, and dispositions to pursue their dreams and contribute back to the community.

  

</p><p style="text-align: justify">My staff and I will build upon the progress the school has made.&nbsp; We will continue to nurture the strong culture of care that exists in the school community; we will continue to do our utmost to inspiring and grow each child; and we will do this is in close partnership with our parents and community partners.
