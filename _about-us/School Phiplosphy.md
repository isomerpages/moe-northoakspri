<p style="text-align: justify">Every child matters at Northoaks Primary School. The philosophy of the school is to provide a holistic and meaningful education with character building as the focal point for every child who enters the school. The name of the school conjures up an image of a forest full of oaks which are strong, tall, beautiful and unique. With a safe, respectful, caring and positive learning environment, our children at Northoaks too will grow to possess these similar qualities. With a sprawling school ground and lush greenery around the school, we envisage Northoaks Primary to be a school within the garden â€“ where every child is like a young plant, passing through the hands of the teacher as a gardener, nurturing every child and taking the responsibility for the development of the individual child.
