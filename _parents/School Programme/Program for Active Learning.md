Program for Active Learning (PAL) for Primary 1 and Primary 2
-------------------------------------------------------------

The NKPS PAL focuses on engaged learning and teaching via a strong teacher and student relationship. It equips our students with the necessary skills and values to thrive in a fast-changing and globalised future.

During PAL, students are exposed to varied and fun learning experiences that facilitate their holistic development in the physical, cognitive, social, aesthetics and moral domains. Students also learn socio-emotional competencies such as respecting others and responsible decision-making. The PAL modules aim to develop confidence in what they do, develop a sense of curiosity and positive attitude towards learning and enjoy group experiences and teamwork.

PAL consists of modules of activities in these broad areas:

*   Sports and Outdoor Education
*   Performing Arts

> o   Dance

> o   Drama

> o   Music (New in 2021)
> 
> o   Visual Arts

**P1 Music (New in 2021)**

This year, the school has designed the P1 PAL Music module with the aim of enhancing the learning experience of our students through musical activities. The learning experiences would help the students to develop their ability to listen, sing, dance, play and express themselves musically.
