Total Defence Day is commemorated annually to mark the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942. Students were engaged with various activities that helped them understand the importance of defending our country. This year, our students were privileged to be able to interact with the police officers. A booth was set up by the Neighbourhood Police Centre officers to create awareness on crime prevention. Students truly enjoyed the interaction with the police officers!

To experience Total Defence Day in a more meaningful way, students and teachers had to go through a food rationing exercise in 2017. Coupons were used to redeem sweet potato porridge from the canteen vendors. Students had a taste of the food our forefathers had during war time.

A skit was also put up by teachers and students to illustrate the importance and significance of Total Defence Day to the students. Total Defence Day is definitely alive in Northoaks Primary School. A quiz was also included as part of the skit on Total Defence Day<br>
