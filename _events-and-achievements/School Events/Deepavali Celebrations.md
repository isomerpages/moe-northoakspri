Deepavali, also known as the festival of lights, was celebrated on 25 October 2017. Aligned with our efforts to nurture confident speakers, the assembly programme was presented by two students from Primary 4. They educated the rest of the school on the Hindu customs and the observances during Deepavali. Everyone was also treated to an elegant dance by one of our students, who is a member of the International Dance CCA. To round up the celebrations and to end on a high note, our teachers led the school in a mass dance.
