<p style="text-align: justify">Every year, all Primary 5 students are invited to attend the National Education Show, which is essentially a preview of the National Day Parade.   The theme for 2018 National Day "We Are Singapore", celebrates our people, our nation and our home. A pledge of unity and togetherness among our diverse cultures, "We" in this year's theme emphasises the collective, where regardless of our origins and wherever we are, Singapore is our way of life and will always be our home.   "We Are Singapore" defines the Singapore Spirit, invoking the strength and resilience which built Singapore and empowers Singaporeans to overcome future challenges and adversities together. It reminds us that we will collectively shape and be responsible for Singapore's future.   This year, the NE Show was held at the Marina Floating Platform with the Singapore city skyline as its magnificent backdrop. The students enjoyed the show thoroughly despite the rain. It definitely did not dampen their spirit at all. The parade has definitely evoked a sense of patriotism amongst the students and has imparted to them the significance of National Day.
