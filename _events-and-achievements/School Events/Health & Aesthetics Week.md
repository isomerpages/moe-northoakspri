<p style="text-align: justify">The Health & Aesthetics Week was held in Term 2 Week 2. The event is a collaboration between the PE Department and the Aesthetics Department to celebrate our learning. Students were treated to a wide range of PAM (PE, Music & Art) activities during recess and PAM lessons.


<p style="text-align: justify">For PE, the Lower Primary pupils experienced the Roving Carnival Exhibition by HPB. They learnt health tips through the interactive boards and activities. The students also went through the active recess activities such as the Nerf Gun shooting and playground. Lastly, during PE lesson, pupils made use of the map reading
skills to navigate around the school and complete a plethora of tasks that include the health and physical domains.

The students also took part in the Music Quiz and uploaded snippets of their music performance via the SLS padlet, as part of the school’s efforts to encourage student’s participation in the Talent Showcase.

<p style="text-align: justify">For Art, the pupils' artistic senses were put to good use through various hands-on activities.  There was the P4 Museum-Based Learning (via Zoom) for the Primary 4 pupils. There was the Art SYF showcase at the school compound and Art quizzes/learning stations. These activities further enhance the appreciation of the Arts among our pupils.
