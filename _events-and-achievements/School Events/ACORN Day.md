ACORN Day is a day where we not just celebrate our students’ achievements but also appreciate our parents. A parent of each of the prize winners is also invited to go on the stage to receive a token of appreciation from us.  
  
The school believes that a strong partnership between school and parents is one of the necessary ingredients to nurture the child in Northoaks. To recognise the diverse talents of our students, performances are put up by the different CCA groups.
