This year, a total of 157 students called the Camp Challenge (Sembawang) their home for two nights from 22 to 24 March 2018.  
  
Our objectives are to foster teamwork and promote interaction among the students. The activities, planned aimed at building character and instilling the school core values in our students. Students went through a variety of experiential learning activities like Rafting, Low Elements activities, Archery and Lazer activities. These activities fostered closer friendships and camaraderie among the students.  
  
The campfire was held on the second night of the camp where parents and staff were invited to celebrate the students' achievements and camp experiences. Our campers put up group performances and sang and cheered amidst the glowing campfire.  
  
The students had a great time bonding with their peers. Some students mentioned that they appreciated the experience and got to know one another better. These experiences created fond memories of their Primary School education and this was positive affirmation that the camp had achieved its objectives.
