<p style="text-align: justify">Northoaks Primary School is pleased to go BIG on Breakfast! Parents are invited to have breakfast with their children monthly or on alternate months to encourage parent-child bonding. In the hustle and bustle of everyday life, we often miss out on such opportunities. We hope parents will continue to spend precious moments eating and bonding with their children whenever possible. See you at the next ‘Breakfast with Parents’ session! <br>
