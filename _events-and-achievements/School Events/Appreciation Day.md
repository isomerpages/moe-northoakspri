Our Principal presenting the cards and tokens of appreciation to our support staff.

The annual Appreciation Day is a celebration of the efforts and contributions made by the Executive and Administrative Staff (EAS), Operational Support Officers (OSO) and other support staff of the school. Students and teachers wrote notes of appreciation and made cards to thank all these staff for all that they have done for the school. being there for them, not in the classrooms, but in other ways. Students smiled and applauded as these staff went on stage to receive the cards and a token of appreciation. Indeed, the school would not be the same without them. A big kudos to all of them. In addition, certificates of appreciation were also presented to our students who supported the school in the various programmes; like Buddy Reading, Pledge-Taking and Student Leadership. Thank you, students.Â
