As technology progresses and students gain more access to the internet, it is important to help students understand positive online behaviour and guide them to be responsible internet users.  
  
The theme for Cyber Wellness Week 2019 is “Together for a Better Internet”. Through a series of activities in and out of the classrooms, students and staff were guided to understand and handle Cyber Wellness issues. Students were also given opportunities to discuss and demonstrate the three Cyber Wellness Principles – Respect for Self and Others, Safe and Responsible Use and Positive Peer Influence.
