The school welcomed the “Year of the Pig” on 4 February 2019 focussing on the school values of respect and appreciation. 

  

Weeks before the celebrations, students synergised with their classmates to design and create paper crafts relating to the Lunar New Year to decorate their classrooms. During the process, students learnt to respect each other and work collaboratively. 

  

On the day of the celebrations, everyone participated actively. Other than learning about the traditions relating to the Lunar New Year, and appreciating the Chinese culture and beliefs, students were entertained with delightful performances. Some of these performances included an exciting showcase of Wushu moves by our Wushu Team, delightful dance item by our K2 children, and a Chinese ethnic costume parade by our kindergarten and our Primary 1 children together with their parents or members of our parent support group. The highlight of the day was definitely the Lion Dance Troupe performing for the children.
