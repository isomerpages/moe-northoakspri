A team of 36 Primary 5 students and 8 teachers participated in the Overseas Immersion Trip to Hong Kong from 13 to 17 March 2019.     
  
The team had the opportunity to learn from, and learn with the students at Taoist Association Wun Tsuen School (Hong Kong). The team shared with the Hong Kong students about the school’s environment efforts through innovation. They took part in an Art lesson, computer lesson, STEAM project sharing and a Tublock workshop together with their Hong Kong buddies.  
  
Besides the enriching and enjoyable school experience, the team visited places of cultural, historical, environment and subject-related interests such as Hong Kong Housing Authority Exhibition Centre, Hong Kong Space museum, Hong Kong Science Museum, Hong Kong History Museum, Legislative Council of Hong Kong, e-Farm, and others. They also had an experience of local shopping at the Ladies’ Market! Through the immersion programme, the students are more globally aware of people of different nationalities, more appreciative of our country and learn to *take care of their peers.
