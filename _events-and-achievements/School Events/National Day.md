##### National Day Celebrations 

The 2017 National Day Celebrations at Northoaks witnessed the first students-led Observance Ceremony. Students Representatives led the school on the march-past as well as commanded the ceremony. It was a proud moment for both the parade commander and the school.

After the Observance Ceremony, our students, together with the children from our MOE Kindergarten, sang a medley of National Day songs and were treated with stage performances and quizzes. The Students were also engaged with exciting classroom activities to celebrate the nation’s 52nd birthday
