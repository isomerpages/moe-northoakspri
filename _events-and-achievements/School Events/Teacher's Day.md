Teachers’ Day 2017 was a joyous occasion. Students and the school leaders put up an array of performances to tickle the senses of the teachers and show how much they appreciated them for all that they had done. The students danced and sang to the teachers’ delight; and got into a fit of giggles when the school leaders appeared on stage clad in the Northoaks school uniform, acting as children in a classroom while a student acted as their teacher. Teachers wear many hats. Cheers to that! The incorporation of Games Day in the celebration was greeted with joy by all as the students participated in the games which included station games, Captain’s Ball and Floorball. Teachers were facilitating, helping out and having fun with the students even on their big day. Cheers to them again!
