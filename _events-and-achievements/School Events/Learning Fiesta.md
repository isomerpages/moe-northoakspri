<p style="text-align: justify">The Learning Fiesta is an annual learning event in Northoaks Primary School. Students participated in hands-on learning activities designed by fellow students under the guidance of their teachers or by the teachers themselves. Through these activities, students consolidated their learning in the various subject disciplines in fun and enjoyable ways. Children from our MOE Kindergarten@Northoaks also joined us for a day of fun-filled learning.
