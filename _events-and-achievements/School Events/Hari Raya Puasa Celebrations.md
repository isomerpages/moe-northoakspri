It was a fun-filled Hari Raya Puasa celebration for everyone in Northoaks. We were treated to a vibrant Malay dance put up by the students. Our spontaneous students also donned traditional costumes during the fashion parade and received thunderous cheers from their teachers and peers. Amidst the fun, students also learnt about the traditions and customs from the engaging sharing by the teacher emcees!
