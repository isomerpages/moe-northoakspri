### Leading and Learning with H.E.A.R.T.

**Mornings Start with H.E.A.R.T.**  

<p style="text-align: justify">The school believes strongly in providing our students opportunities to lead and learn with H.E.A.R.T. (Honesty, Empathy, Appreciation, Respect and Tenacity). Our Morning Starts with H.E.A.R.T. a pre-assembly programme enhances the authentic learning  of values and social skills through inspirational stories and current affairs from the news and social media. In this programme, students are given the opportunity to discuss age-appropriate contemporary issues such as the COVID-19 pandemic, environmental conservation and social inclusivity with their Form Teachers.<br>

**Leading with H.E.A.R.T.**

<p style="text-align: justify">In NKPS, we believe that every student is a potential leader. 

<p style="text-align: justify">The school recognises that one must first be able to lead oneself in order to lead others effectively. Hence, the school has adopted The Leader in Me (TLiM ) programme to inculcate in students good habits based on the book “7 Habits of Highly Effective People” by Stephen Covey. TLiM helps to equip students with the essential life skills and self-confidence they need to thrive in the 21st century. Our students learn about these habits throughout the academic year, both during the Form Teachers Guidance Periods (FTGP) and pre-assembly programmes.

<p style="text-align: justify">We also believe in the continuous development of our tier 2 and 3 student leaders.  Workshops and on-the-job training are organised to enhance students’ capacity to influence others to uphold the H.E.A.R.T values and practise the 7 Habits of TLiM in school.

#### Towards a Concerned Citizen

  **Learning from the Singapore Campaigns**

<p style="text-align: justify">The school takes effort to imbue in our students a strong sense of national pride and commitment towards nation-building by introducing our students to some of Singapore’s iconic campaigns over the years. Students across all levels are introduced to the different Singapore campaigns such as National Courtesy Campaign, Dental Health, National School Savings, Speak Good English Movement, Stop at 2 and Purple Parade Movement to help them reflect and appreciate how each of these campaigns have contributed to building a more cohesive and stronger nation.  The themes for the levels were organized in a progressive manner to focus on self and family, school and eventually the wider community.<br>

**HEART in Action@Home**

<p style="text-align: justify">The Heart in Action@Home is part of our students’ Values in Action programme. It involves parents or guardians as partners in supporting our student’s character development efforts. This programme, which is an extension of the daily cleaning programme in school, encourages students to play a more active role at home during the school holidays. Through the activities and reflections in the Serve with H.E.A.R.T. logbook, students will be able to put into practice and internalise the values, skills and the TLiM habits, outside the school setting.<br>
<br>

**Values in Action**   

<p style="text-align: justify">With the aims to enable students to exercise social responsibility within their spheres of influence and play their part through meaningful contributions to the family, school and  the community at large, the school drives and implements a myriad of activities across six levels for our students. For example, P1 students learn the importance of water conservation and design posters to create greater awareness among students while P3 students learn the importance of waste reduction and  are engaged in upcycling projects.
