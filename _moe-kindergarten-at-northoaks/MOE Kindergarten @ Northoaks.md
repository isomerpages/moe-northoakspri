<h5>A strong start for every child at MOE Kindergarten</h5>
<p>It takes a big heart to teach little minds. At MOE Kindergarten @ Northoaks,
our children learn through purposeful play. Through the variety of learning
experiences which include neighbourhood walks, field trips, Weeks of Wonder
(WoW) projects and Celebrations, the children get to learn through different
experiences and discover the joy of learning. These experiences engage
the children in discovering and appreciating the world around them and
allow them to share their learning experiences with their peers.</p>
