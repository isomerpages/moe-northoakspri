<p><strong>About the CCA</strong>
</p>
<p>The Environment Science Club was established in January 2017. It is made
up of environment enthusiasts who champion the school’s efforts in conserving
the environment within and beyond the school. In partnership with the World
Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF), the Environment Science Club forms the
Eco-schools committee. The team is engaged in learning and tackling real-life
environment issues such as recycling of waste, conservation of water and
energy and cultivating biodiversity in the school.</p>
<p>Opportunities such as assembly talks, energy and water campaigns and celebration
of World Water Day are provided for the team to raise awareness in students
on man’s impact on the environment thereby encouraging them to play their
part in conserving the environment. The club also conducts sharing sessions
to engage the community beyond the school in recycling projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students are also tasked to engage the community to promote upcycling
and work towards Environment sustainability. Our members have been advocating
Environment education to members of the public through various engagements.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>

<p><strong><u>Goodman Community Farm Learning Journey （26 April 2023）</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our Primary 3 and Primary 4 CCA members explored a vibrant community urban
farm, discovering diverse plant and bug species. The 1.5-hour hands-on
session showcased sustainable farming practices, fostering teamwork and
camaraderie. This immersive experience broadened their horizons and instilled
values of environmental stewardship. We hope it inspires them to make conscious
choices for our planet's well-being. The Goodman community farm excursion
provided practical insights and educational value.</p>

<p><strong><u>Solar Energy Learning Journey at ITE @ College East (17 May 2023)</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Primary 5 and Primary 6 CCA students visited ITE @ College East to
learn about solar energy. They explored the components of a solar energy
system, learned about the different renewable energy sources in Singapore,
and toured one of the facilities with solar-powered panels. The visit emphasized
the importance of renewable energy and sustainability. Students gained
a deeper understanding of solar power's potential and its role in mitigating
climate change. The experience empowered them to make environmentally conscious
choices and consider renewable energy alternatives. In addition, our students
engaged in a hands-on activity where they used toilet rolls and leaves
to create upcycled bracelets.</p>

<p><strong><u>NSS ESN 2nd Symposium 2023</u></strong>
</p>
<p>NSS ESN Symposium is organized by Nature Society Singapore (NSS), as part
of their ‘Every Singaporean A Naturalist’ (ESN) flagship citizen science
project and nature education programme. ESN programme is aimed at nurturing
hearts and minds for nature, and ultimately lead participants to support
advocacy and conservation of the natural environment around us. The annual
symposium is thus organised as a form of end-of-year gathering and platform
for participating schools to share their experiences and learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our P3 team actively participated in the Biodiversity Race earlier in
the year and meticulously documented their learning through a video presentation.
This presentation was not only showcased within the school but also shared
on the Facebook page of our community partner, Sayang Sembawang. The team
further had the opportunity to present their project and insights during
the symposium, contributing to the collective learning and collaborative
spirit of the event.</p>
