<p><strong>About</strong></p><p>The Environment Science Club was established in January 2017. It is made up of environment enthusiasts who champion the school’s efforts in conserving the environment within and beyond the school. In partnership with the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF), the Environment Science Club forms the Eco-schools committee. The team is engaged in learning and tackling real-life environment issues such as recycling of waste, conservation of water and energy and cultivating biodiversity in the school.</p><p>Opportunities such as assembly talks, energy and water campaigns and celebration of World Water Day are provided for the team to raise awareness in students on man’s impact on the environment thereby encouraging them to play their part in conserving the environment. The club also conducts sharing sessions to engage the community beyond the school in recycling projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Students are also tasked to engage the community to promote upcycling and work towards Environment sustainability. Our members have been advocating Environment education to members of the public through various engagements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Teachers-in-charge</strong></p><p>Miss Lim Wan Rong (teacher-in-charge)</p><p>Eric Tan Aik Hong</p><p>Mdm Nirwani</p><p>Mdm Nur Fadillah</p><p>Mdm Muslimah</p><p><strong>2019 Community Outreach Programmes</strong></p><p>The Environment Science Club hopes to engage our community in the efforts to sustain our environment.

Both groups used recycled materials to promote Northoaks’s upcycling efforts. Our Eco-team leaders were actively educating Sembawang residents on how to upcycle plastic bottles into a “self-watering” garden. One of our student ambassadors showed Dr Lim Wee Kiak (MP for Sembawang GRC) our upgraded version of “self-watering” garden. They innovated the bottled garden using Design Thinking protocols in their creation. <br></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:430px" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/env2.png"></div><p><br><strong>2019 Hosting China Schools in collaboration with NEA</strong></p><p>Environment Science Club has collaborated with NEA to co-host visitors from China.
