<p><strong><u>Netball</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Netball CCA provides an extraordinary opportunity for our girls to
immerse themselves in the fast-paced and exhilarating world of netball.
We aim to nurture personal growth, foster teamwork, instill sportsmanship
and promote a love for the game.</p>
<p>The pupils will also learn to embrace the values of excellence and fair
play. Every week, the girls are given training in basic ball skills, stamina
building, agility and coordination exercises under the close supervision
of the coach and teachers-in-charge.</p>
<p>The girls are given exposure to represent the school in various competitions
to maximise their potential.</p>
