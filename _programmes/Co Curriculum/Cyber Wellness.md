**What is Cyber Wellness?**
<br>Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users. It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to protect oneself in cyberspace. The focus of CW is about helping students to become responsible digital learners. When navigating cyberspace, students should demonstrate respect for self and others, and practise safe and responsible use. Students should also be a positive peer influence by harnessing technology for collaboration, learning and productivity, as well as advocating positive use of technology for the good of the community.  
  
**MOE’s Cyber Wellness Framework**
<br>MOE uses the CW framework to develop the child’s instinct to protect and empower him/her to take responsibility for his/her own well-being in cyberspace. The three principles, ‘Respect for Self and Others’, ‘Safe and Responsible Use’ and ‘Positive Peer Influence’ when adhered to will anchor a child’s well-being in cyberspace as he/she will then be able to make careful and well-considered decisions.

  

**Principles**&nbsp;

**(1) Respect for Self and Others**&nbsp;

Students need to:&nbsp;

*   uphold their own dignity when online (e.g. share appropriate content and participate in only legal online activities)&nbsp;
*   respect other people online (e.g. put themselves in others’ shoes, accept diverse views and opinions, give credit when using other people’s work and seek permission where necessary, avoid sharing hurtful materials).

**(2) Safe and Responsible Use**&nbsp;

Students need to:&nbsp;

*   have an understanding of the risks of harmful and illegal online behaviour, and take steps to protect themselves (e.g. keep their personal information private, verify the reliability of information using various sources, take steps to avoid dangers they may encounter online).&nbsp;
*   make wise and healthy choices (e.g. maintain a healthy balance of their online and offline activities)

**(3) Positive Peer Influence**

Students need to:&nbsp;

*   be a positive role model online (e.g. share healthy and positive content, harness the affordances of technology to do good for society)
*   advocate positive online behaviour (e.g. stand up for their peers online, report cases of cyber bullying to a trusted adult/authority, post encouraging remarks on social media)&nbsp;
