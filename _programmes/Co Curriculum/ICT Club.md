<p><strong>Coding and Drones Programming</strong>
</p>
<p>Students in the ICT Club learn to use the Scratch coding software in Primary
4. They gain the knowledge of different programming functions and create
simple coding sequences. &nbsp;In Primary 5, the students learn to programme
drones using the Swift Playground application. Using the application, students
learn to programme the flight sequence before syncing it to the drones
to check the accuracy.</p>

<p><strong>Video Production</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students also learn video production skills. At Primary 4, students are
introduced to a variety of technical skills using the iPad. They also learn
the fundamentals of post-production using the Video Maker Software which
is available in the Windows 10 suite. As they progress to Primary 5, students
learn to use DSLR cameras. Students are encouraged to explore different
ways to present their ideas. The students’ creativity is further developed
in Primary 6. &nbsp;Students work together in groups on a video project
to reinforce their video production skills. Students learn the importance
of collaboration through the training activities.</p>
