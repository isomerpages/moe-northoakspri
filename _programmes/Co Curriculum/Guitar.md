<p>We are thrilled to introduce the Guitar Ensemble as a new CCA at our school.
This exciting CCA allows primary school students to embark on a musical
journey together, learning how to play the guitar and creating beautiful
melodies as a team.</p>
<p>In this CCA, students are given the opportunity to learn and perform confidently
as a team. Through training sessions and rehearsals, students will improve
their teamwork, coordination, and gain confidence in their musical abilities.
It also develops their guitar-playing skills, learn songs of various genres
and styles and have the chance to showcase their talent at school events,
concerts and in future prestigious competitions such as the Singapore Youth
Festival.</p>
<p>With these opportunities, students can make new friends who share their
passion and even take on leadership roles within the ensemble. This will
allow them to develop valuable leadership skills and contribute to the
growth and success of the ensemble</p>
