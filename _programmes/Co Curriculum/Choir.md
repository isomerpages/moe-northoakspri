<p><strong>About the CCA</strong>
</p>
<p>Choral singing is not one of life’s frills. It is like a great oak that
rises up from the centre of the human race and spreads its branches everywhere…
&nbsp;It reaches to the depths of humanity, our sense of community. It
expresses your soul in song. &nbsp;At Northoaks, all children love to sing.
At Choir, we provide opportunity where students learn choral techniques
and discover their talent to project their voices, sing in pitch and sing
in harmony. Choral singing is a skill that lives with you forever. You
equip a child with singing skills and he/she becomes confident of performance
and showmanship. It builds self-esteem and unleashes students’ creativity
with choreography and harmony. It builds leadership skills as students
take charge of sectional trainings, planning for bonding sessions, school
and external events.</p>
