<p><strong><u>Modern Dance</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Modern Dance Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) at our school stands out
not just for its captivating performances but also for the unwavering dedication
of its dancers. With a strong emphasis on contemporary dance forms such
as hip-hop and street dance, the team members pour their heart and soul
into every practice session, displaying a remarkable commitment to their
craft.</p>
<p>The Modern Dance CCA believes in the power of dance as a means of self-expression
and storytelling. Through the exploration of diverse contemporary dance
styles, we encourage our pupils to push their boundaries, experiment with
different movements, and find their own unique voice within the art form.
Whether they are beginners or experienced dancers, we welcome students
of all levels and provide a space for them to learn and grow together.</p>
<p>Our CCA fosters a sense of teamwork and collaboration. Alongside technical
skills, we also focus on developing creativity, musicality, and stage presence,
empowering our dancers to communicate their emotions and ideas through
their performances.</p>
<p>Through their involvement in the Modern Dance CCA, we hope our pupils
will develop not only as skilled dancers but also as confident and resilient
individuals. Dance requires discipline, dedication, and perseverance, and
these qualities are instilled in our dancers as they strive for excellence.
Our CCA encourages self-confidence, self-expression, and a positive body
image, promoting a healthy and well-rounded approach to dance and life.</p>
