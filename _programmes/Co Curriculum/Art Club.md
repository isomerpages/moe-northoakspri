<p><strong>ABOUT THE CCA</strong>
</p>
<p>The Art Club is, and has always been, the CCA of choice for students with
the love and passion for the Visual Arts. Our members get to enjoy an enriching
experience as they learn art theories and put these theories to good use
in the creation of their own artworks using various media such as Ceramics,
Mixed Media Sculpturing and painting. They also have the opportunity to
get inspirations from professional artists and other student artists, and
take part in external events such as the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF)
and other external competitions.

<p><strong><u>Our SYF 2023 Journey</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The year 2023 started off as a busy and challenging one for all the P3
to P6 Art Club teachers &amp; members and also 3 selected Primary 2 pupils
(Yu Xin, Eleonor and Shreya). From January to March 2023, we were engaged
in an artistic journey to create artworks for eventual submission to the
SYF 2023 Art Exhibition.</p>
<p>In Term 2 Week 1, we celebrated the successful completion of our SYF journey
by showcasing and presenting our completed artworks with pride and confidence
to the School Leaders, Mr Cher and Mrs Hee. Three of these works were eventually
submitted to the SYF Exhibition panel for consideration in early April
2023.</p>
<p>The selected artworks were also showcased at the Spiral Staircase for
2 weeks from April to May 2023 to create awareness of our pupils’ participation
in this nationwide exhibition and also to motivate all our pupils (not
just our Art Club members) to have an even greater love for art.</p>
<p><strong>We are proud to announce that one of these artworks, titled ‘<em>The Plastic Monster</em>’, has received the <em>Certificate of Recognition </em>award in the SYF Exhibition 2023.</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;In this SYF journey, teachers and pupils alike have demonstrated
pure passion and creativity. From the brainstorming of ideas, to the prototyping
and the creation of the actual artworks, we never gave up and demonstrated
the school value of tenacity right to the end. For that, we are all winners
in this SYF journey! Congratulations to all the participants of this event!</p>
