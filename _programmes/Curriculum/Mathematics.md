<h3>Learning through the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (C-P-A) Approach</h3>
<p>Our students learn and understand mathematical concepts using concrete
manipulatives, practical pictorial examples and collaborative group work
and activities.

<p><strong>Mathematics is Everywhere!</strong>
</p>
<p>In addition to classroom-based lessons, our students engage in Math-related
activities to reinforce their learning by applying Math knowledge and skills
both during class and break times. Beyond games, we organize Math trails,
allowing students to experience real-life examples of Math concepts at
home, in school, and in the wider community. We also incorporate real-world
activities like baking and shopping, where students apply their Math learning
and develop essential life skills. These activities provide opportunities
for students to demonstrate their mathematical problem-solving skills and
reasoning. Working in teams, our students enjoy solving puzzles, tackling
complex situations, and engaging in practical applications of Math, making
it both fun and relevant.</p>
<p>Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) Programme</p>
<p>The LSM Programme is an early intervention initiative designed to help
Primary 1 to Primary 4 students build a strong foundation in numeracy skills
through targeted instruction. This programme ensures students grasp fundamental
concepts while developing their interest and confidence in Math learning.
Through small group learning, students attain fluency in basic Math facts,
laying a strong foundation for their conceptual development. By supporting
struggling students early, the programme helps prevent future learning
gaps and fosters long-term success.</p>

<p>Mathematics Enrichment</p>
<p>Students who display an interest and aptitude in Mathematics are invited
to participate in the Math enrichment programmes:</p>
<p><strong>Entrepreneurship Programme</strong>&nbsp;
<br>Our students learn basics of entrepreneurship. They are challenged to
develop higher order thinking skills, stimulate creative ways to solve
non-routine problems and learn financial literacy concepts that would help
them apply their Math knowledge to practical situations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Math Olympiad Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Math Olympiad Programme cultivates our students' interest and enthusiasm
for Mathematics while enhancing their academic skills through rigorous
learning opportunities that challenge and deepen their understanding of
subjects. By fostering critical thinking and problem-solving abilities
necessary for tackling complex questions and scenarios, the programme not
only prepares students to excel academically but also develops their capacity
for reasoning and critical thinking. Additionally, the programme broadens
students' horizons by introducing them to a diverse range of topics beyond
the standard curriculum, thereby enriching their overall educational experience.</p>
<p><strong>Mathematics Competitions</strong>
</p>
<p>Selected students are offered opportunities to represent the school in
local and international competitions, providing them with invaluable experience
in solving a variety of challenging math problems and exposure to different
competition formats. This exposure not only hones their skills but also
allows them to interact with like-minded peers. Participating in these
competitions enhances students' interest in Mathematics and boosts their
confidence in tackling complex problems. Moreover, it fosters personal
growth, resilience, and the ability to thrive under pressure, contributing
significantly to their overall development.</p>
