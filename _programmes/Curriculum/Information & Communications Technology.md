<h3>ICT Curriculum</h3>
<p>The ICT Baseline Standards form the basis of the ICT curriculum. Students
will acquire skills such as basic typing skills and will also learn how
to use Microsoft Office software such as Word, Powerpoint, Excel and Movie
Maker.&nbsp;</p>

process and plans ICT-infused lessons across the curriculum. Through the
active learning process, the school aims to equip student with the skills
and dispositions to be self-directed and collaborative learners.</p>
