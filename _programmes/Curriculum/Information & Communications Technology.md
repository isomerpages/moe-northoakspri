<h3><strong>ICT Department Focus:</strong></h3>
<p>The school’s ICT department programmes are aligned to the “Transforming
Education through Technology” Masterplan 2030, which outlines how schools
can better leverage technology to enhance teaching and learning. The ICT
department is committed to equipping both students and teachers with essential
digital skills and ensuring a positive online experience. Our focus is
on three key areas:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Promoting digital literacy</strong> to
help students confidently navigate and use Educational Technology tools,
including Student Learning Space (SLS).
<br>
</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Fostering a safe online environment</strong> by
educating students about cyber safety and responsible internet use.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Integrating innovative technology solutions</strong> by
empowering our teachers with professional development progammes focused
on leveraging EdTech tools and Student Learning Space in lesson design
using the Ed Tech Pedagogical Scaffold that facilitates collaborative and
interactive learning experiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Student Learning Space</strong>
</p>
<p>The Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) is an MOE learning portal that
enhances teaching and learning at Northoaks Primary School. It provides
students with access to curriculum-aligned learning resources, allowing
them to learn at their own pace according to their individual needs and
interests. Additionally, through lessons designed by teachers using SLS,
the platform promotes collaborative work amongst students, supporting their
growth into responsible and future-ready learners.</p>
<p>Through the SLS, students gain greater ownership of their learning and
engage in collaborative work. Aligned with the development of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century
Competencies (21CC), the SLS promotes self-directed learning and teamwork,
fostering a sense of student ownership. This process helps students discover
the joy of learning and prepares them for future challenges.</p>

<p><strong>Code for Fun Programme by IMDA for Primary 6 students</strong>
</p>
<p>The Code for Fun Programme is a 10-hour enrichment programme that will
be conducted in Term 4 for Primary 6 students. This programme exposes the
students to computational thinking through coding, inventive thinking through
digital making, and emerging technologies. During the sessions, students
will get first-hand experiences with robotic kits and/or microcontrollers.
They will also be exposed to emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence</p>
<p><strong>Cyberwellness</strong>
</p>
<p>The school aims to develop students to become responsible digital users.
It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to
protect oneself in cyberspace.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This year, our school took part in Safer Internet Day, an annual global
initiative which aims to promote safer and more responsible use of online
technology and mobile devices among children and young people.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Students participated in a Screen-Free weekend where they took the time
to remove themselves from technology and engaged in screen-free alternatives
such as playing board games and taking a walk in the park with their parents.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The school also partnered Cyber Security Agency (CSA) to bring an engaging
assembly programme and mobile booths to the students. Through the assembly,
students learnt good cyber hygiene such as not sharing passwords and being
safe online. Students put their knowledge to the test to win prizes in
the mobile pop-up booths.</p>
