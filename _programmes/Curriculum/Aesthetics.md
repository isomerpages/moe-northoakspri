<h3>The Northoaks Art Curriculum:</h3>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Young Artists' Programme</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p><em>A Journey in Artistic Exploration.....</em>
</p>
<p>Here in Northoaks Primary School, we believe that every single child has
the innate ability to create, enjoy and appreciate art. Most important
of all, we believe that everyone has the potential to develop into passionate
&amp; confident young artists. This is why we call our art curriculum the&nbsp;<strong><em>Young Artists' Programme</em></strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taking reference from MOE's new 2024 Art Syllabus, our art modules are
based on the 3 broad focus areas of 'Self&nbsp;<em>and Immediate Environment', 'Singapore in Past, Present and Future' and 'The World and the Region We Live in'.</em>&nbsp;For
each of the modules, students draw inspirations from (MOE-approved) artworks
by local and international students and artists and learn art history &amp;
theories, and media ranging from oil pastel, paint to ICT art, and create
their own artworks.</p>
<p>The Young Artists' Programme aims to develop students with:</p>
<p>i)&nbsp;<strong>Visual Inquiry Skills</strong>&nbsp;to discover and explore
their surroundings.</p>
<p>ii)&nbsp;<strong>Confidence</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Curiosity,</strong>&nbsp;~and~&nbsp;<strong>Imagination</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Enjoyment</strong>&nbsp;in
art making and art discussion.</p>
<p>iii)&nbsp;<strong>Awareness</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Respect</strong>&nbsp;for
histories and cultures of key&nbsp;<strong>Artworks</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Artists</strong>&nbsp;in
Singapore and the World.</p>

<h3>The SchoolARTS@SCH project</h3>
<p>The SchoolARTS@SCH project started in 2019 with&nbsp;14 schools and has
seen a steady increase in the&nbsp;involvement of different schools since
then.&nbsp;Our Primary 4 students contributed 15&nbsp;artworks to one of
the Singhealth Community Hospitals.</p>
<p>The Singapore Community Hospitals are&nbsp;Bright Vision Hospital, Outram
Community Hospital&nbsp;and Sengkang Community Hospital. These&nbsp;hospitals
use artworks to beautify&nbsp;their lift lobbies and common corridors.</p>
<p>Please view our students' artworks in the <a href="https://www.artsteps.com/view/622b02f1c4bc55e6c124af17" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">virtual art gallery</a>

<p>To allow students to learn&nbsp;<strong>Handchimes, Angklung and Ukulele skills</strong>&nbsp;and
to appreciate pitch, rhythm and beats through the learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To equip our students with&nbsp;<strong>Social Emotional Learning (SEL)</strong>&nbsp;and
to reinforce the school values&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>‘H.E.A.R<sup>2</sup>.T’</strong>&nbsp;(Honesty,
Empathy, Appreciation, Respect, Responsibility, Tenacity).
