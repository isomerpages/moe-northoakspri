<h3>Leading and Learning with H.E.A.R<sup>2</sup>.T.</h3>
<p><strong>Mornings Start with H.E.A.R<sup>2</sup>.T.</strong>
</p>
<p>The school believes strongly in providing our students opportunities to
lead and learn with H.E.A.R<sup>2</sup>.T. (Honesty, Empathy, Appreciation,
Respect, Responsibility and Tenacity). Our Morning Starts with H.E.A.R<sup>2</sup>.T.
preassembly&nbsp;programme&nbsp;enhances the authentic learning&nbsp;of
values and social skills through inspirational stories and current affairs
from the news and social media. In this&nbsp;programme, students are given
the opportunity to discuss age-appropriate contemporary issues such as
the COVID-19&nbsp;pandemic, environmental conservation and social inclusivity
with their Form Teachers.</p>
<p><strong>Leading with H.E.A.R<sup>2</sup>.T.</strong>
</p>
<p>In NKPS, we believe that every student is a potential leader.
<br>
</p>
<p>The school recognises that&nbsp;one must first be able to&nbsp;lead&nbsp;oneself
in order to lead others effectively. Hence, the school has adopted The
Leader in Me (TLiM&nbsp;) programme&nbsp;to inculcate in&nbsp;students&nbsp;good
habits based on the book “7 Habits of Highly Effective People” by Stephen
Covey.&nbsp;TLiM&nbsp;helps to equip students with the essential life skills
and self-confidence they need to thrive in the 21st century. Our students
learn about these habits throughout the academic year, both during the
Form Teachers Guidance Periods (FTGP) and pre-assembly&nbsp;programmes.</p>

<p>We also believe in the continuous development of our tier 2 and 3 student
leaders. Workshops and on-the-job training are organised to enhance the
students' capacity to influence the others to upload H.E.A.R<sup>2</sup>.T.
values and practise the 7 habits of TLiM in school.

<h3>Towards a Concerned Citizen</h3>
<p><strong>Learning from Singapore Campaigns</strong>
</p>
<p>The school takes effort to imbue in our students a strong sense of national
pride and commitment towards nation-building by introducing our students
to some of Singapore’s iconic campaigns over the years. Students across
all levels are introduced to the different Singapore campaigns such as
National Courtesy Campaign, Dental Health, National School Savings, Speak
Good English Movement, Stop at 2 and Purple Parade Movement to help them
reflect and appreciate how each of these campaigns have contributed to
building a more cohesive and stronger nation.&nbsp; The themes for the
levels were&nbsp;organized&nbsp;in a progressive manner to focus on self
and family, school and eventually the wider community.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>H.E.A.R<sup>2</sup>.T. in Action@Home</strong>
</p>
<p>The H.E.A.R<sup>2</sup>.T. in&nbsp;Action@Home&nbsp;is part of our students’
Values in Action&nbsp;programme. It involves parents or guardians as partners
in supporting our student’s character development efforts. This&nbsp;programme,
which is an extension of the daily cleaning&nbsp;programme&nbsp;in school,
encourages students to play a more active role at home during the school
holidays. Through the activities and reflections in the Serve with H.E.A.R<sup>2</sup>.T.
logbook, students will be able to put into practice and&nbsp;internalise&nbsp;the
values and skills, outside the school setting.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Values in Action</strong>
</p>
<p>With the aims to enable students to exercise social responsibility within
their spheres of influence and play their part through meaningful contributions
to the family, school and&nbsp; the community at large, the school drives
and implements a myriad of activities across six levels for our students.
For example, P1 students learn the importance of water conservation and
design posters to create greater awareness among students while P3 students
learn the importance of waste reduction and&nbsp; are engaged in upcycling
projects.</p>
