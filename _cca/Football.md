**About**
<br>Football is a sport that provides experiential opportunities for students to develop a strong character that portrays perseverance, determination, discipline, resilience and teamwork which are aligned to our school’s H.E.A.R.T values. Through the guidance and expertise of our dedicated and experienced coaches and teachers, we aim to develop the passion for football in our young players. 

We do not only focus on developing and honing football technical skills of our players, such as dribbling, passing, tackling and football strategy, but also to develop them into responsible leaders and  active contributors to the society.

**Teachers in-charge:** 
<br>Mr Mohamad Rizal Bin Marof (Main teacher-in-charge)
