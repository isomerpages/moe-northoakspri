**ABOUT THE CCA**

The Art Club is, and has always been, the CCA of choice for students with the love and passion for the Visual Arts. Our members get to enjoy an enriching experience as they learn art theories and put these theories to good use in the creation of their own artworks using various media such as Ceramics, Mixed Media Sculpturing and painting. They also have the opportunity to get inspirations from professional artists and other student artists, and take part in external events such as the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and other external competitions.
