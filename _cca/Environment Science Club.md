**About**

The Environment Science Club was established in January 2017. It is made up of environment enthusiasts who champion the school’s efforts in conserving the environment within and beyond the school. In partnership with the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF), the Environment Science Club forms the Eco-schools committee. The team is engaged in learning and tackling real-life environment issues such as recycling of waste, conservation of water and energy and cultivating biodiversity in the school.

Opportunities such as assembly talks, energy and water campaigns and celebration of World Water Day are provided for the team to raise awareness in students on man’s impact on the environment thereby encouraging them to play their part in conserving the environment. The club also conducts sharing sessions to engage the community beyond the school in recycling projects.  

Students are also tasked to engage the community to promote upcycling and work towards Environment sustainability. Our members have been advocating Environment education to members of the public through various engagements.

Environment Science Club student ambassadors have collaborated with the CCE department to partner with NTUC Foodfare to reach out to the community at Admiralty’s hawker centre to promote and educate the residents on the importance of self-tray returning.
